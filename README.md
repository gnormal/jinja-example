# jinja-example

An example of generating text output using jinja2 templates.

This repo uses https://github.com/kblomqvist/yasha to render jinja2 templates,
using Gnorm's template engine option.

Everything in the `./generated` directory was generated by gnorm when pointed at a
database with the schema defined in `gnorm.sql`, using the jinja2 templates in the
root directory.

books.json is an example of the json output that gnorm produces for a specific
table (in this case the books table) and is fed into the templates.
